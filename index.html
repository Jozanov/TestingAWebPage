                    <p>
                        I wish I could change my present career and kick start as a manual tester. I am generally motivated in making my every day as interesting as possible. Why Manual Testing? Testers seek for underlying complexity beneath the apparent simplicity. They are
                        generally called professional ‚Äúskeptics‚Äù, because they are here to encounter reality. They are here to challenge developers in a good way. Being a tester means being a rapid learner. It means it is an ongoing self-education!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Writing test cases and scenarios , thinking about mistakes and weaknesses in system takes a lot of effort which I am willing to give. Manual testing is the key to make a bullet-proof app. So much effort is needed to produce a neat and clean or "dry" product.
                        There can be a bug behind any corner. Problems (bugs) everywhere. Prioritization, analyzing, optimization, stability, support etc. all this is needed to balance knowledge, time and money.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would like to become a part of a team where I can develop myself from the very beginning. Do not want to jump and unsafely walk over areas... Want to take time and dig deeper into details and tweak or fine-tune every little option. ‚ÄúMaybe this will
                        work‚Äù is my motto :)
