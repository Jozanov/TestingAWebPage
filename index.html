	<h2>
		Summary
	</h2>

	<p>
		I wish I could change my present career and kick start as a manual tester. I am generally motivated in making my
		every day as interesting as possible. Why Manual Testing? Testers seek for underlying complexity beneath the
		apparent simplicity. They are generally called professional “skeptics”, because they are here to encounter
		reality. They are here to challenge developers in a good way. Being a tester means being a rapid learner. It
		means it is an ongoing self-education!
	</p>

	<p>
		Writing test cases and scenarios , thinking about mistakes and weaknesses in system takes a lot of effort which
		I am willing to give. Manual testing is the key to make a bullet-proof app. So much effort is needed to produce
		a neat and clean or "dry" product. There can be a bug behind any corner. Problems (bugs) everywhere.
		Prioritization, analyzing, optimization, stability, support etc. all this is needed to balance knowledge, time
		and money.
	</p>
	<p>
		I would like to become a part of a team where I can develop myself from the very beginning. Do not want to jump
		and unsafely walk over areas... Want to take time and dig deeper into details and tweak or fine-tune every
		little option. “Maybe this will work” is my motto :)
